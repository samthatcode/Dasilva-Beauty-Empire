                    focus
                    should be on the woman's individual beauty, not the make-up. <br /><br />
                    the wedding - one of the most important days in woman's life. A bride's styling should not only

                    based on the sample, we create a look according to your ideas. the possibilities for this range from
                    a simple,
                    natural style to an eye-catching, intense look.

                    Do you no longer feel comfortable in your clothes?
                    You have no idea how to dress correctly according to your body shape?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Did you answer yes to all of these questions? Then you should come to my style advice!<br /><br />
                    I do not offer classic color and style advice. Why? Because it only emphasizes your own type, but
                    most of the time it doesn't improve it. There are often situations in which you have to
                    change.<br />
                    With your consultation, I would like to create a positive attitude towards life so that you can
                    present yourself better and also feel that way.<br />
                    There can be many reasons for such a change - a new love, a professional reorientation or simply a
                    break from old patterns.<br />
                    We'll take a trip to your wardrobe together. I will help you to select, sort or find new
                    combinations that you have not thought of before.<br />
                    The best way to experience fashion and reinvent yourself is to go shopping with me as your
                    companion.
